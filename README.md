# P-n-lopePG_EEG-ADHD
This project is realized as part of the Brainhack School 2020.

Summary
ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder which manifests itself through a variety of cognitive and 
behavioral symptoms. It is well known in the ADHD litterature that there are many subtypes of this
disorder, but not all research papers agree on what these subtypes are. Those subtypes are also
mostly based on behavioral and self-report data and not on neurophysiological assessment.

Using EEG data from young adults with ADHD, we will investigate the presence of subtypes and
the possible associations between the reported and behavioral symptoms and the different 
amplitude and distribution of the brainwaves.


Details
Our sample consists of 209 college students with ADHD. EEG was performed using a 32 channel 
electrodes cap while participants were resting with their eyes opened for 5 minutes. Time-frequency 
analysis were performed in order to extract the mean amplitude of each frequency for each electrode.
Neuropsychological measures include
- Conners questionnaire (self-report)
- WAIS-IV working memory subscale
- IVA-II behavioral test

Analyses
Using clustering, we will identify which symtoms of ADHD are present in the same individuals; identifying
possible subtypes of the disorder. Those clusters will then serve as label for a classification 
algorithm whose task will be to predict the ADHD subtype of participants using EEG data. 
This will be realized using python, more specifically jupyter notebooks. 


Tools
Jupyter Notebook
GitHub
Python
BIDS
MNE

Deliverables
We plan on making our data-set BIDS-compatible using MNE python. 
The project will also be published in a github repository.
